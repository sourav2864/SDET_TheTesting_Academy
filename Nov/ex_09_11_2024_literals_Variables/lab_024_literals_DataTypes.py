"""
In programming, **literals** and **data types** are both fundamental concepts, but they serve different roles:

### 1. **Data Types**
- **Definition**: Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold. They define the characteristics of data, such as size, range, and operations that can be performed on the data.
- **Examples**: Common data types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), strings (`str`), characters (`char`), booleans (`bool`), and complex types like arrays, lists, or objects.
- **Purpose**: They help the compiler or interpreter understand how to store and manipulate data, ensuring that operations performed on the data make sense (e.g., adding two numbers vs. concatenating strings).

### 2. **Literals**
- **Definition**: A literal is a specific, fixed value directly written in code, representing constant data of a particular data type.
- **Examples**:
  - Numeric literals: `42`, `3.14`, `-7`
  - String literals: `"Hello, world!"`, `'A'`
  - Boolean literals: `True`, `False`
- **Purpose**: They provide a way to initialize variables or represent fixed values directly in the code without requiring computation or transformation.

### Key Difference:
- **Data types** are the classifications that tell us about the nature of data, while **literals** are the actual fixed values of those data types that appear directly in the code.
